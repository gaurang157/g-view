# G-View: Auto EDA

g-view is a Python library that provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for Automated Exploratory Data Analysis (Auto EDA). With g-view, you can easily visualize and analyze your dataset's characteristics, distributions, and relationships.

## Installation

You can install g-view using pip:

```bash
pip install g-view
```

## Usage

Once installed, g-view can be launched globally from the command line. Simply type `g-view` and press enter to start the application.

```bash
g-view
```

The g-view application GUI will launch, allowing you to perform Auto EDA on your dataset interactively.
